Update 1.17
1. Due to the speed in which some games complete, I've increased the total ticket amount from 200 to 300 tickets in conquest maps
2. New chat commands!
  - Type "!time" or "/time" to view hours spent on the server
  - Type "!help" or "/help" to view some quick tips
3. New killfeed announcements!
  - "Big Game Hunter" plays if you kill a person vendetta'd against you, and they're top on the leaderboard
  - "Bottom Feed" plays if you kill a person vendetta'd against you, and they're bottom of the leaderboard
  - "Last Second Save" if you clear a flag moments before it's captured
4. 10 new guns!
  - Icarus-37, a slam-fire shotgun that fires faster the longer you shoot it
  - Knife Kitty's HK416, an old classic coming back (mirrors the balancing of the AR-15)
  - ACR-E, finally an ACR for everyone who's been itching for one (mirrors the balancing of the R5)
  - The Black Ops II pack has been added!
    - M27 (Mirrors the balancing of the G36C)
    - Peacekeeper (Mirrors the balancing of the AUG-A3)
    - MP7 (yes, there's 2 now, mirrors the balancing of the original one)
    - HAMR (mirrors the balancing of the M249)
    - R870 MCS (mirrors the balancing of the M3 Super 90)
    - B23R
    - Dragunov SVD
5. 3 new perks!
  - Entrench: "Remaining still provides an outgoing 15% damage boost for, and an incoming 10% damage reduction buff against, all damage types."
  - Expertise: "Your proficiency with weapons enables you to perform certain actions, such as reloading, better than normal."
  - Vampir: "Your health slowly drains, but damaging enemies heals you and can overheal you, capping at 150 hp."
6. Balancing changes
  - RFB has had its damage increase from 48 to 58 in an attempt to make it a viable option
  - Regeneration has had its regeneration rate increased from 120% to 140%, to help keep it competitive across all current and new life-giving perks
  - Spawn-protection now lasts an additional 100 units away from the initial spawning point (this was triggering the end of the protection far more frequently than the timer)
  - Players with spawn-protection also appear more transparent than previous
7. Miscellaneous changes/improvements
  - Thornmail now displays a crosshair icon on the attacking player, indicating the damage reversal
  - Removed all skin-based attachments from weapons, something that should have been done with 1.16
  - Frag grenades are now properly given to players

PERK ORDER AND WEAPON ORDER HAVE BEEN MOVED TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE NEW PERKS AND WEAPONS, I APOLOGIZE IF THIS DISRUPTS ANYONE'S GAMEPLAY
