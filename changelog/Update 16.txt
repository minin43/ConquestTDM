Update 1.16 - Re-launch Update (live 5/25/2020)
1. **8** new maps
- dm_drift
- de_paris_subway
- cs_east_borough
- gm_battleground_nodes
- gm_boreas
- npc_galleria_mess
- rp_limanskhospital
- gm_explore_tunnel
2. New game "type": Conquest Resupply. Plays like a standard conquest game but the map shifts halfway through the game depending on who's winning & losing. Currently enabled for 1 map: gm_boreas
3. Weapons received new balancing
- Assault rifles and SMGs have had their randomized spray patterns reduced significantly or to nothing. This should make shots land loads more consistently.
- M3 Super 90 and SPAS-12 have both received small damage buffs
- Spreadsheet found at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d9TbkQBZr8WpzEM1EtNd64b8EA9_2OokHf701kYT_fw/edit#gid=0
4. Lifeline received small buff to scaling movement speed
5. Other new features
