What needs done for next update:

        - Will all need to be the same size
    - Consider button sounds
    - Note about achievement titles - needs to be made to the community
        Tracking for new title progression only begins when it's been added to the game, total time played, total kills, total deaths, and flag captures
        are the only exclusions to this rule. If anyone has a good idea for new titles, suggest them sooner rather than later
    - Players want a gun overhaul
    - Need to finish weapon position in shop menu
