Future ideas:
    - New Modes
        - Shifting flags & spawns based on game performance
            - Need to expand the workshop tool to inlcude invisible walls a la nZ
            - Maps: zs_, gm_boreas
        - I had an idea about something 1-life related, but IDK if it fits CTDM
        - Some "advance" mode, like assault in UT2004
    - New equipment
        - Some ammo-giving shit
        - More explosives, like a claymore
