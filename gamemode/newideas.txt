Future ideas:
    - New Modes
        - Some "advance" mode, like assault in UT2004
    - New kill events & associated sounds
        Killing machine -> end the game with the most kills
        Juggernaut -> 
        Maniac -> 
        Warpath -> 
    - Balancing concerns:
        - npc_galleria_mess, red side
        - cs_east_borough, stairs that look into red spawn
        - rp_limansk blue side spawn fucking SUCKS
    - Perk ideas
        - Donasan - shooting friendlies heals them
    - Add back in PhD Flopper? Since now we have anti-explosive equipment, also can reduce movespeed shortly after using it?

    FINAL THINGS BEFORE 1.20
    - Add CSS CORRECTLY
