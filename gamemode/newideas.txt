Future ideas:
    - New Modes
        - Some "advance" mode, like assault in UT2004
    - New kill events & associated sounds
        Killing machine -> end the game with the most kills
        Juggernaut -> 
        Maniac -> 
        Warpath -> 
    - Balancing concerns:
        - npc_galleria_mess, red side
        - cs_east_borough, stairs that look into red spawn
        - rp_limansk blue side spawn fucking SUCKS
    - Perk ideas
        - Donasan - shooting friendlies heals them
        - Perk MASTERY (essentially is play-to-win, after reaching an achievement with the perk, get extra bonuses)
    - Add CSS CORRECTLY
    - Rework Deathscreen, split it into 3 sections: 
        1. name & title (title should go ABOVE the name, not before it)
        2. extra fun info (all currently shown info, plus kills on and deaths against for this game)
        3. tooltip if needed (if you keep dying to a specific perk)
    - Loadouts can carry across maps
    - Scoreboard should look at extra VIP groups
