Future ideas:
    - New Modes
        - Some "advance" mode, like assault in UT2004
    - New equipment
        - Some ammo-giving shit
        - More explosives, like a claymore
    - New kill events & associated sounds
        Killing machine -> end the game with the most kills
        Juggernaut -> 
        Maniac -> 
        Warpath -> 
    - Deathscreen should display titles above or below the name, not before it
    - Balancing concerns:
        - gm_boreas
        - npc_galleria_mess, red side
        - cs_east_borough, stairs that look into red spawn
    - Add new guns:
        - COBOL Fate
    - Tooltips should pop up in the deathscreen if players keep dying to enemies running a specific perk
    - Perk ideas
        - Donasan - shooting friendlies heals them
        - Perk MASTERY (essentially is play-to-win, after reaching an achievement with the perk, get extra bonuses)
    - Add CSS
